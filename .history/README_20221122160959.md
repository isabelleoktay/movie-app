# Movie Search App

This movie search app was built using React Native for the front-end and Node.js and MongoDB for the back-end. The initial data was presented as separate CSV files that I manipulated into a single JSON file using Python Pandas and Jupyter Notebooks. Please see the folder **dataset** in my backend folder for documentation on how I manipulated the data. Once I manipulated the data, I uploaded the JSON file to MongoDB Atlas. Finally, this app is deployed using Heroku [here](https://movie-search-diesel.herokuapp.com/).

# Front-end

Using React, I developed the front-end. Each movie is represented in a table and styled using Tailwind for CSS. The movie table is populated using data that is fetched from the back-end.

## Running the front-end locally

If you would like to run the front-end locally in development mode, you can run:

### `npm start`

# Back-end

Using Node.js and MongoDB, I developed the back-end. The server is made using Express. In order to connect to my MongoDB Atlas database, where all the movie data is stored, I create a MondoClient using my Atlas URI. I have different routes to handle different requests to access data frommy Mongo Atlas database. The backend is deployed on a separate Heroku server, which my frontend fetches to retrieve the movie data.

## Running the back-end locally

If you would like to run the front-end locally in development mode, you can run:

### `npm start`

# Issues

Originally, I had planned to use MongoDB Atlas's Search Index function to implement autocomplete. However, because of issues through the MongoDB Atlas provider, my search indices would not return any results. Instead, following the recommendation of a suggestion functionality, I fetch the movie data from my backend and display the results conditionally based on the input matching any movie title in the database. That is, as a user types, the displayed movies are only those whose title matches a part of the user's input.
