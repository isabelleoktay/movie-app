# Movie Search App

This movie search app was built using React Native for the front-end and Node.js and MongoDB for the back-end. The initial data was presented as separate CSV files that I manipulated into a single JSON file using Python Pandas and Jupyter Notebooks. Please see the folder **dataset** for documentation on how I manipulated the data. Once I manipulated the data, I uploaded the JSON file to MongoDB Atlas. Finally, this app is deployed using Heroku.

# Front-end

Using React, I developed the front-end. Each movie is represented in a table and styled using Tailwind for CSS. The movie table is populated using data that is fetched from the back-end.

## Running the front-end locally

If you would like to run the front-end locally in development mode, you can run:

### `npm start`

# Back-end

Using Node.js and MongoDB, I developed the back-end. The server is made using Express. In order to connect to my MongoDB Atlas database, where all the movie data is stored, I create a MondoClient using my Atlas URI. I have different routes to handle different requests to access data frommy Mongo Atlas database.

## Running the back-end locally

If you would like to run the front-end locally in development mode, you can run:

### `npm start`
